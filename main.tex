\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
Over the past century, there has been an abundance of evidence to suggest that the majority of the mass density of the universe is composed of non-luminous/non-interacting matter. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are a leading candidate motivated by both theoretical and cosmological arguments. The LUX-ZEPLIN experiment employs a dual-phase liquid xenon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) to detect WIMP-nucleon interactions. The TPC is surrounded by a veto system consisting of an instrumented xenon skin layer (Skin) and gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator (GdLS) Outer Detector, primarily used to veto neutron backgrounds which mimic WIMP interactions in the TPC.

In the Outer Detector, an array of 120 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are used to veto interactions which do not only interact in the TPC, as expected from the WIMP signal. In particular, it is optimised for detecting scintillation light from the interaction of $\gamma$-rays produced by neutrons which capture in the GdLS. This work presents the commissioning of the Outer Detector and the single photoelectron calibration of the Outer Detector PMTs which enables the single photoelectron sensitivity required to observe low energy interactions in the Outer Detector resulting from neutrons scattering in the Outer Detector. Through-out the 2024 WIMP search science run, a single photoelectron sensitivity stability of $(1.37\pm0.25)\%$ at an operating gain of $2\times10^6$ has been achieved.

Improvements to the Outer Detector simulation geometry are reflected in the comparison between the measured and simulated neutron capture timing, with good agreement. The optimisation of the veto coincidence selection for the 2024 WIMP search analysis resulted in an estimated neutron tagging efficiency of $(92\pm4)\%$ with a cost of 3\% of the detector live time. This result presents a factor of two reduction in live time cost by the veto coincidence selection whilst maintaining the same tagging efficiency achieved in prior analyses. Estimates of neutron backgrounds from material screening and simulation are not reliable enough for science searches. The veto coincidence was used to select a neutron rich data set which is used to constrain the number of nuclear recoil single scatter events which result from background detector neutrons. An expectation of $0.0^{+0.2}$ single scatter events result from the background detector neutrons in the 2024 WIMP search.

To further understand the neutron background of LZ, an initial muon flux measurement has be performed to understand the rate of atmospheric muons through the detector which subsequently can produce neutrons through interactions with the detector and surrounding material. A reconstructed flux of $(5.119 \pm 0.080 \textrm{( stat.)} \pm 0.049 \textrm{ (syst.)})\times10^{-9}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ is derived from the ratio of muon rates found in data and simulation. The observed muon flux is stable over long time periods, however the best fit diurnal muon modulation frequency $f=(1/21.7)^{+0.005}_{-0.007}~\text{day}^{-1}$ is found with a local significance of $3.05\sigma$ with $p=0.001$. This will work will motivate further studies of the muon induced neutron flux in LZ.
In addition to the muon flux measurement, the muon veto has been developed to remove events which follow muon tagged events which have high rates of ionisation pulses. The veto was initially developed for the WS2022 science run and later optimised for the WS2024 science run. The muon veto has an impact of 1.3\% on the WS2024 detector live time. 

The characterisation and optimisation of the Outer Detector were a critical contribution to the 2024 WIMP search analysis performed by LZ. The search achieved the best sensitivity to spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interactions in the world for WIMP masses $>9~\text{GeV}/c^2$.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I'll start this by saying, I know this is the only part of my thesis that most people will read so I'll make it worth your while. I've been fortunate to work with so many wonderful people over what seems like an twelve year journey which started back in my home town of Liverpool. If I've left you out, I'd like you to know that whatever impact you have had on me has not gone un-noticed. By no means is this a short and sweet set of acknowledgements so please bare with me on this.

Firstly, I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Bj\"orn Penning for affording me this opportunity. I first met Bj\"orn in a Weatherspoons of all places whilst attending an LZ collaboration meeting in Oxford. My memory of our first encounter still remains blurry but I do remember the two of us discussing an opportunity for me to join him at Brandeis University in Boston. After being bundled into a taxi and sent on my way after too many beers, I woke up the next day (still feeling the effects of the previous night's antics) and made my way to the conference hall to arrive on time at 8am. Whilst the room was pretty empty with only folks who had not partaken in the festivities present. I scanned the room to see Bj\"orn sat with a pair of sunglasses at his laptop looking busy. He came over to join me and in his deep German accent uttered the words, \textit{``hey man, I like your work, we should talk later about a PhD position.''}, suggesting he was impressed that I'd been out late the night before and still made it on time for the talks, unlike others. After some messages back and forth, he invited me to Boston to check out the university and to see if I'd be interested in the position. I'd enjoyed my trip to Boston and went on to accept the position, little did I know that a couple of weeks later I'd be told that the group would be moving to the University of Michigan. Not knowing anything about the university or even where Michigan was, I trusted Bj\"orn and in the fall of 2020 moved to the US. Since then, you've taught me a lot, not only how to present myself as a physicist but also how to enjoy every aspect of what we do on a day-to-day basis. And most importantly, dragging me out of the office for a beer when I needed it most. Lastly, I'd like to thank you for chance to move with the group once more, to the beautiful city of Z\"urich. I look forward to working with you further in the future.

Whilst at the University of Michigan, I shared offices with many great people: Luke Korley, Mike Williams, Sam Eriksen, Miguel Hernandez, Greg Rischbieter, Erin Barillier, Chami Amarasinghe, Chris Wright, DQ Huang, and Maris Arthurs, thank you for all the great laughs and physics. To Luke, Mike, Sam, Chris and Noah Green, thanks for all the great and wild times as room-mates, the memory of attending the A$\Delta\Phi$ frat party will remain in my mind rent free. Long live the Ypsi Crack Den! To Jon Alty, Devin Bryant, and Craig Reiley who I met through the collective love of climbing, thank you for all of the fantastic trips to mountains which have made me the climber I am today. I reflect back on fond memories of us hanging out on the porch roof of my Packard St. apartment and the midweek kayaking nights on the lakes around the biker bar in Hell, MI. 

For the majority of the my PhD, I spent my time working on site at the LZ experiment which is situated in the beautiful Black Hills of South Dakota. During that time, I'd often pinch myself and ask the question, \textit{"how the hell has a lad from Liverpool ended up here?!"}. But for over three years of my life, I called the Black Hills my home. I count myself lucky to have worked with some of the kindest and most welcoming people I've ever met, the list of people is very long and includes: Dale Curran, Jeff Barthel, Derek Lucero, Markus Horn, Charles Maupin, Jake Davis, Gavin Cox, Alex Geffre, Julia Degaurdio, Chad Dunbar, Doug Tiedt, Robyn Varland, and Sarah Wortman. To Dale, I thank you for everything you taught me on the countless climbing trips and for the great conversations on the long car journeys we shared travelling across Wyoming. You are a true friend and I see you as another great older brother who I can lean on for advice when I need it most. I look forward to having you over to climb with me in the alps!

This work could not have been completed without the collaborative efforts of the people who work on the LZ experiment. Having dipped my toe into many areas of the experiment, I've worked closely with many amazing people who have taught me a lot. In no particular order, I want to thank Jack Bargemann, Greg Blockinger, John Armstrong, Ryan Wang, Sally Shaw, Scott Haselschwardt, David Woodward, Dev Khaitan, Eryk Druszkiewicz, Elise McCarthy, Ellie Bishop, Linda de Felice, Frank Wolfs, George Homenides, Harry Nelson, Hugh Lippincott, Jack Genovesi, Markus Converse, Simon Fiorucci, Teal Pershing, Tomasz Biesiadzinski, Jemima Tranter and Vitaly Kudryavtsev. To Jack B., thank you for the good times and hard climbs, whether it be the time we were ice climbing in the Canadian Rockies or hanging of the side of El Capitan in a storm. I look forward to eventually climbing Denali with you, a goal we've had in our sights since sharing Christmas 2020 together! To Jemima and Vitaly, with whom I worked closely on the muon studies discussed in this thesis, thank you for many discussions about the analysis supporting the flux measurement and in writing the corresponding paper. Lastly, to Sam Eriksen, thank you for the guidance through the veto efficiency studies. This work is the cornerstone of this thesis and wouldn't have been executed with the same level of proficiency without your help.

To the Liverpool group: Sergy Burdin, Will Turner, Ewan Fraser, Megan Carter, Sam Woodford, and Angie Reid, thank you for providing me a place to work and welcoming be back to the department with open arms whenever I was visiting home. Sergey, you afforded me the opportunity to start my career in research, introducing me to dark matter and the LZ experiment with development of the Outer Detector Optical Calibration System. This work provided me the foundation from which this thesis progressed from.

After moving one final time in my PhD, I landed in Z\"urich and our group grew in size. To be have been surrounded by kind and understanding people during the final throws of this PhD has made this process much more bearable, those people were: Miguel Hernandez, Erin Barillier, Leslie Juigne, Rebecca Hampp, Nicolas Angelides, Knut Mor\aa, Alex Kavner, and Abigail Flowers. Many thanks to Knut, Nicolas, and Alex, for taking the time to review this work, it'll really got me through my final week of writing! To Miguel, oh Miguel, thanks for being such a wonderful friend and housemate. You made making my move to Z\"urich easy, finding a place for us to live and showing me the city. We'll continue to seek out the best kebap in town!

Upon moving to Z\"urich, I joined the Akademischer Alpen-Club Z\"urich which has allowed me to  create a community with people who share the love for climbing and skiing, some of those club members that have shared some great days in the mountains with are: Matej, Tim E., Nick, Sebastiaan, Janna, George, Martin, Daniel, and Mariana. After giving a talk about my trip to Nepal to climb Cholatse, I met Tim Western. A chap from the South-West of England, also doing a PhD and who had just moved to the city. I have to thank Tim for all the Binz sessions, cranking on the splatter board on those cold winter nights, following me up hard ice climbs in Cogne with George in tow, and convincing me that climbing the Matterhorn two weeks before this thesis was due was a good idea. It turned out to be a great couple of days with an unanticipated speed-hike down to Zermatt from the hut to catch the last train back to Z\"urich.

Over the years I've travelled back and forth to the UK, visiting home. It's always been great to return home and feeling like I've never left. For this I have to thanks the lads who I played canoe polo with for Friends of Allonby Canoe Club: Jay, Lewis, Kartik, Suryan, Shivan, Santanam, Jack, Andreas, and Mathias. Also thanks to Michael Moffitt who as my coach instilled a sense of discipline and perseverance which I carried into all facets of my life, including applying the principles he taught me to my studies. Thanks to Daniel, Michael JP, Tom, Adam, Tayler, Hamish, Oliver, Nick and Ihusan, who I was fortunate to have met whilst studying at the University of Liverpool. Conversations in the early years with you all inspired me to continue with research and are part of the reason why I'm in this position today. Here's to many more good times on trips away skiing and climbing.

Lottie, my love, where do I begin? It's difficult to put into words how much I appreciate your support, patience, and love during the most challenging period of my life. How have I been so lucky to have met such a wonderful, kind and caring person, you are far too good for me and have put up with more than your fare share of my b.s. than you ever should have! Thank you for the daily calls where you've listened to me drone on about muons, efficiencies and uncertainties, whilst remaining engaged when most other people would've fallen asleep. This work would not have been possible with you by my side. I look forward to the day when we'll close the distance and live in the same city together, where that will be is a question for the future. But until then I'll be happy to chase you down the slopes and up the climbs on our adventures in the mountains we both love. \textit{Lots of kiss!}

And finally my family, Dad, Oliver, Charlie, Jeannie, Jen, Alice and Buster, thank you for the love and support you've all given me over the years, whether that be a place to stay when returning home to video calls keeping me connected with the family and easing the inevitable home sickness one feels whilst living away. Dad, I don't know how you did it, you've been able to raise three wonderful sons alone after we lost mum, keeping the family afloat, working tirelessly with whatever job provided the best for us at the time. You are the reason why I have made it this far, and I'm the man I am today. You taught me to try my hand at everything and never to say you couldn't do something. If I'm half the man and father you are, I'll be happy. Lastly to my mum, Karen, who I dedicate this work to. You were taken from this world far to soon and you were unable to see what your three boys have become. I hope I've done you proud with the path I've chosen in life and as always, you are forever in my heart and always on my mind.

To reiterate my opening statement, I've been so lucky to have worked with so many wonderful people and I'm thankful for the support people have afforded me over the years! Stay the best!
