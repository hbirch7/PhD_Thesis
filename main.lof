At the center is the liquid xenon TPC (1), monitored by two arrays of PMTs and serviced by various cable and fluid conduits (upper and lower). The TPC is contained in a double-walled vacuum insulated titanium cryostat and surrounded on all sides by a GdLS Outer Detector (2). The cathode high voltage connection is made horizontally at the lower left (5). The GdLS is observed by a suite of 8” PMTs (3) standing in the water (4) which provides shielding for the detector.
